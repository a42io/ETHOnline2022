# General

OpenProof delivers an open source seamless token-gating solution for real-world and online use cases of ticketing/proving features.

Anyone can easily manage limited events for ticketing/proving, token-gating where only those with a particular NFT and participants can prove that they have one of the NFT or ENS. There is no need to install Apps, what you only need it a browser to show your proof.

OpenProof currently supports tokens on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon Matic, Optimism Mainnet, and Arbitrum Mainnnet. Supporting token formats are ERC-721, ERC-1155, ENS, and ENS subdomains.
